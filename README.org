** About

Emacs package for saving point positions in a ring-like history.

I know about =C-u C-SPC=, registers and bookmarks and I use all of
those, but it's not enough for me, so I wrote this little package.

** Usage

To save current position, use =point-pos-save= command.

To go to a saved position, use =point-pos-goto= / =point-pos-next= /
=point-pos-previous=.

To delete current position, use =point-pos-delete= (with =C-u= delete
all).

See also the commentary of =point-pos.el=.
